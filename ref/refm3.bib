abstract = "A new graphical display is proposed for partitioning techniques. Each cluster is represented by a so-called silhouette, which is based on the comparison of its tightness and separation. This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate’ number of clusters."

abstract = {We propose a method (the ‘gap statistic’) for estimating the number of clusters (groups) in a set of data. The technique uses the output of any clustering algorithm (e.g. K-means or hierarchical), comparing the change in within-cluster dispersion with that expected under an appropriate reference null distribution. Some theory is developed for the proposal and a simulation study shows that the gap statistic usually outperforms other methods that have been proposed in the literature.},

abstract = "This paper proposes a new algorithm for K-medoids clustering which runs like the K-means algorithm and tests several methods for selecting initial medoids. The proposed algorithm calculates the distance matrix once and uses it for finding new medoids at every iterative step. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we use some real and artificial data sets and compare with the results of other algorithms in terms of the adjusted Rand index. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm takes a significantly reduced time in computation with comparable performance against the partitioning around medoids."
