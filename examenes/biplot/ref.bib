  abstract = {{Classical biplot methods allow for the simultaneous representation of individuals (rows) and variables (columns) of a data matrix. For binary data, logistic biplots have been recently developed. When data are nominal, both classical and binary logistic biplots are not adequate and techniques such as multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), latent trait analysis (LTA) or item response theory (IRT) for nominal items should be used instead. In this paper we extend the binary logistic biplot to nominal data. The resulting method is termed “nominal logistic biplot”(NLB), although the variables are represented as convex prediction regions rather than vectors. Using the methods from computational geometry, the set of prediction regions is converted to a set of points in such a way that the prediction for each individual is established by its closest “category point”. Then interpretation is based on distances rather than on projections. We study the geometry of such a representation and construct computational algorithms for the estimation of parameters and the calculation of prediction regions. Nominal logistic biplots extend both MCA and LTA in the sense that they give a graphical representation for LTA similar to the one obtained in MCA.}},

Since 2000 the wine trade has grown significantly and its structure has experienced major changes. Such changes are shaping the current competitive scenario of the wine market and are the base elements for its future development. The paper analyses the growth of world wine imports, considering all wines together and the single categories recognized by global statistics (bottled, bulk and sparkling wine). It then describes the changes in the geography of importers with the emergence of new markets and the competitive performance of the main suppliers. The bulk wine trade, the re-export of wine and the exposure of trade flows to trade barriers are also analyzed in detail. Finally, on the basis of the dominant trend in wine consumption and changes in the supply chain, the critical issues arising from analysis are examined, with the need for further research being underlined."

  abstract = {{Overall wine consumption in Spain is decreasing, while at the same time, designation of origin (DO) wine consumption is increasing gradually. This study examines Spanish DO wine consumer behavior by the use of a choice experiment technique. A main-effects model as well as an interaction-effects model is estimated based on four attributes: designation of origin, price, wine aging, and grape variety. Willingness-to-pay estimates, depending on the price segment, is derived for switching from one attribute level to another. Consumer segmentation is undertaken based on purchase frequencies. Market simulations are presented for consumer segments. Empirical results indicate the importance of the DO and the wine aging attributes on wine selection. The interaction-effects model shows the importance of attribute interactions on consumers' choice process. Differences as well as similarities are detected among consumer segments.

Emotions have been generally associated with products but there has been little published research on emotions related to food, and more specifically to wine. Every culture may describe its emotions in different ways and may have its own emotional lexicon, allowing feelings to be socially shared: the purpose of this research is to develop a list of emotional adjectives appropriate to the Italian culture to describe the feelings of wine consumers. By means of three studies, we selected 16 words which allow wine consumers to describe their feelings while consuming wine. The emotion terms selected could be divided into two categories: high/low arousal and high/low pleasantness. Unlike the general prevalence in the emotional lexicon of languages of words expressing unpleasant emotions, most of the 16 Italian terms focused on emotions elicited by wine consumption fall into the pleasure category."

From this viewpoint, this paper shows ethnocentric tendencies and identifies wine consumer preferences from Madrid and Barcelona. These cities are characterised as large consumption and business centres and as showcases to promote Spanish wine. The aim of the research was to detect business opportunities for wine produced in Castile-La Mancha. To achieve this objective, 800 wine consumers were personally interviewed. Data processing consisted of determining the degree of consumer ethnocentrism through the Consumer Ethnocentric Tendency Scale and determining wine consumer preferences through the Conjoint Analysis technique, depending on their degree of ethnocentrism. As a general result it is deduced that consumers from Madrid and Barcelona have no ethnocentric behaviour, which is an opportunity for products from other regions, specifically for wine. So, while Madrid consumers know and prefer Castile-La Mancha wines, which can give rise to diversification of the supply by introducing high-end wines, in Barcelona these wines are the least preferred. Therefore, conducting communication campaigns that aim at changing their current image is the priority to enter this market."

The total consumption of alcohol has declined in Spain, France and Italy and the consumption of wine has shown a declining trend in all the countries studied. The traditional beverage, wine, has in Spain, Portugal and Italy been substituted by a new beverage with lower alcohol content, beer. In France the decline in wine consumption has not been substituted by the use of other alcoholic beverages. No noticeable internationalization in beverage preferences has taken place in Spain, Portugal or Italy, whereas imported beverages have gained some ground in France.},
